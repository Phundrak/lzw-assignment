* LZW Compressing tool

This is a university assignment for which I aim to create an LZW algorithm implementation to create a small tool similar to =gzip= and =gunzip= that can compress and uncompress files in a lossless fashion.

This project is written is C++17, compiled with clang under a UNIX environment. Other compilers and environments will not be tested.
